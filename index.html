    <h2> Reading</h2>
        <p id="readingbio"> I love reading books as they help me improve my vocabulary. Books are my best friends. Whenever I feel bored, I read books. Reading books broadens my Imagination and enhances my creativity. I love reading fiction, adventure, mystery, non-fiction, myths, science, space, comics, western etc. Books are also very informative. Every book allows me to learn new things and explore new ideas. Books impart valuable lessons from years of experiences. A book will always be my best friend.

        <h2> Dancing</h2>

        <p id="readingbio"> I also love dancing. Dancing is my passion. I learn two very different genres of dance, house and freestyle. House dance has roots in the underground house music scene of Chicago and New York. It is typically danced to loud and bass-heavy electronic dance music provided by DJs. Freestyle is a way of dancing in which the dancer improvises his/her moves on the spot, as he/she dances, instead of having them planned (i.e. choreography). In its most extreme form, it is the opposite of choreography; however, it can be argued that such an intense level can never be reached, as we all, to some degree, plan our moves. While dancing, I/you/he/she can do the gracefully or go hard. I like to dance gracefully when the song is slow and wants to go hard when it is fast and upbeat. Usually, when the music slows down, dancers go down on the floor and stand and dance while the song is active and lively.

<h3>Galileo Galilei</h3>
    <div class="line1"></div>

Galileo Galilei is my inspiration. I’ve always wanted to become an astronomer when I grow up. Studying the stars, the universe, the planets, and other heavenly bodies, will be fabulous. When I was five, I stared at the sky and asked my father, ‘What are the stars made of? Why do they shine so brightly?’. I know the answer to all these questions now, but I still don’t know the answer to another billion questions! Let me tell you a few facts about Galileo Galilei:
<br>
<br>

1. Galileo has been called the “father of observational astronomy”, the “father of modern physics”, the “father of the scientific method”, and the “father of modern science”. 
        <br>
        <br>
2. Galileo developed one of the first telescopes. 
        <br>
        <br>
3. In early 1610, he made the first in an extraordinary series of discoveries. He spent numerous weeks examining a set of stars near Jupiter as they revolved around the planet. He had discovered Jupiter’s four moons, which he named the Medicean Stars, but which have since been renamed the Galilean moon, in his honour.
        <br>
        <br>
4.Galileo also observed the phases of planet Venus and the existence of far more stars in the Milky Way that weren’t visible to the naked eye.

JK Rowling is also my inspiration. I've always liked the bookos that she has written. She has inspired me to write my own stories, novels and poems. Her books are very interesting and I just can't put tem. This has inspired me to write stories which will not bore the readers and instead make it so intersting that the reader would not want to not put the book down.  Here are a few facts about J.K Rowling:
        <br>
<br>

1. Joanne Rowling is best known for writing the Harry Potter fantasy series, which has won multiple awards and sold more than 500 million copies,[becoming the best-selling book series in history!
        <br>
        <br>
2. Rowling also writes crime fiction under the pen name Robert Galbraith.
        <br>
        <br>
3. She donated so much money for charity, that she lost her billionaire status.
        <br>
        <br>
4. J.K Rowling's first Harry Potter manuscript was rejected by 12 publishers before Bloomsbury picked it up.
